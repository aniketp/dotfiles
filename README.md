# Shell-Configs
Collection of all the configuration files made to ease and speed up the significant part of my life spent on shell. Well, these serve as a means of procrastination too.

```

## Acknowedgement
The original construct and idea of creating config files in this fashion belongs to my mentor [**Shivansh Rai**](https://github.com/shivansh). I believe I'll have to copy most of his [code](https://github.com/shivansh/dotfiles) during the initial stage of preparing my own personalized configs.
