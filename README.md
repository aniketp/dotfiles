# Shell-Configs
Collection of all the configuration files made to ease and speed up the significant part of my life spent on shell. Well, these serve as a means of procrastination too.

```
           ______       ____  _____          ____        
          / __/ /  ___ / / / / ___/__  ___  / _(_)__ ____

                                               /___/

## Acknowledgement
The original construct and idea of creating config files in this fashion belongs to my mentor [**Shivansh Rai**](https://github.com/shivansh). I believe I'll have to copy most of his [code](https://github.com/shivansh/dotfiles) during the initial stage of preparing my own configs.
